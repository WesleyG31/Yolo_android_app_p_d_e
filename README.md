# 🧸🔍 Custom Image Recognition with YOLO + Android App 🚀

Recognizing My Pokémon Plushies with AI! 🤖✨
This project combines computer vision and deep learning to detect Pokémon plush toys using YOLO (You Only Look Once). But that’s not all…

I'm now taking it to the next level by integrating the trained model into an Android app 📱🔥!

Check out the project in action in this video:

# 📲 Bringing YOLO to Android

Once the model was trained, the next step was to bring it to mobile devices 🚀. Now, this repository also includes the Android Studio app, which allows real-time recognition of plush toys directly through the phone's camera.
